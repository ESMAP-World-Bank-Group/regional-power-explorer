# Regional Power Explorer

An interactive web map for exploring **open-access electricity-sector data** — generation
mix, installed capacity, power plants, grid infrastructure, cross-border trade, electricity
access, tariffs, and renewable-energy resources — at world, regional, and country level.

It is developed in the framework of [ESMAP](https://www.esmap.org/) / World Bank energy planning activities. The tool aggregates and
harmonises data from many open sources so that planners, analysts, and decision-makers can
get a quick, sourced overview of a country's power system. It can be used to help populate
inputs for the [Electricity Planning Model (EPM)](https://github.com/ESMAP-World-Bank-Group/EPM),
but it is a **standalone data-exploration tool** and is not limited to EPM.

> **Scope — what it is and isn't.** The Regional Power Explorer *aggregates and visualises
> already-published open data*. It is **not** a power-system model, it does **not** run
> simulations or forecasts of its own, and the figures it shows are **indicative**: coverage
> and accuracy vary by region. Always cross-check against national statistics before using
> the data for planning or official purposes. See [Limitations & Disclaimer](#limitations--disclaimer).

## Data sources

All layers, their sources, versions, update frequency, coverage, and a quality indicator are
documented in the in-app **Data Sources** page (`/about`). Key sources include ENTSO-E,
OpenStreetMap, the WRI Global Power Plant Database, Global Energy Monitor, the Global Solar
Atlas, ERA5, Our World in Data, Ember, and national statistical offices.

Data licences include: OpenStreetMap (ODbL), WRI GPPD (CC BY 4.0), Global Energy Monitor
(CC BY 4.0), Natural Earth (Public Domain), and others as listed on the Data Sources page.

## Tech stack

- **React 19** + **Vite** (build/dev)
- **MapLibre GL** for the interactive map
- **React Router** for navigation
- Deployed on **Vercel**

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # local dev server (Vite, HMR)
npm run build      # production build → dist/
npm run preview    # preview the production build
npm run lint       # ESLint
```

## How data flows

```
data-source/        Raw inputs and pipeline intermediates (git-ignored — kept local, large)
   │  tools/ scripts fetch, clean, and harmonise
   ▼
public/data/        Curated, web-ready data served by the app (committed)
```

Only the curated, web-ready output under `public/data/` is committed. Heavy raw inputs and
caches under `data-source/` are git-ignored (see `.gitignore`) and produced/refreshed by the
scripts in `tools/`.

## Project structure

```

  accuracy vary by country and layer. Quality indicators are provided per source on the
  Data Sources page. Do not use as a sole basis for investment or policy decisions.
- Estimation methods (e.g. demand projections, capacity-factor derivation, wind-speed
  height correction) are documented on the Data Sources / Methods page; treat estimated
  layers accordingly.
